# Bachelor-Thesis-Repository
Repository of Code used in the Bachelor Thesis "Guanine crystal segmentation and classification imaged in the eye of zebrafish embryos"

In _**notebooks**_ the single parts of the image analysis pipeline can be found that helped to develop the _**workflow**_ libraries *(library_crystals, library_crystals_testing)*.

In _**plots**_ are figures and plots shown in the bachelor thesis (enumerated accordingly).

In _**tables**_ are dataframes generated from the acquired crystal data which are required for some notebooks to run.

This project was a shared project between [Robert Haase Group](https://physics-of-life.tu-dresden.de/research/core-groups/bio-image-analysis) and [Rita Mateus Group](https://physics-of-life.tu-dresden.de/research/core-groups/mateus).
